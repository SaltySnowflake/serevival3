2:16 - Draíocht: Hey, if you happened to know or get around to it, we mentioned briefly trade leagues before, I was wondering if you've poked around enough to know where to look to try to make trade leagues able to accept more than OPM, or even if such a thing is possible? I was noticing when adjusting dev that some 2 province Hanseatic states are not (able to be) member's of the trade league, and if you know offhand, I wont waste the time searching.
2:19 - Draíocht: On a related subject, due to all the new provinces pulling trade power every which way, I couldn't get the main republic trade centers to pull as much trade as they should, so I ended up solving it by making a new province modifer and a handful of events/decisions to go with them. I'm not sure if it is anything you'll use, but I thought I'd let you know.

0:19 - Draíocht: Hey, I just uploaded another version to the Alpha Test. Everything other than provinces owned by the Ottomans & East Anatolian tags *should* be done, at least as far as dev is concerned. Every independant tag with over 20 dev in vanilla *should* be exactly the same dev as vanilla, baring new/removed vassals, in which case the total should still add up when including vassals, aside from the following exceptions which I intentionally changed, because I felt vanilla was in error based on historical population records and wealth.

England +1% (Isle of Man, a 3 dev march which just gets tacked on)
Major North Italian Powers (Venice, Genoa, & Milan) +10% dev
Provence -10% dev (PRO actually increased, but vassal Lorraine goes from 35 to 14)
Burgundy +10% (all in vassal dev, mostly in Flanders)
Pommerania -10% dev
Silesia +10% dev
Bavaria -33% dev
Koeln +33% dev
Byzantium +50% dev

I took some liberties with tags under 20 dev, basing numbers off history, rather than making sure to match vanilla. Let me know if you notice anything I missed.
2:17 - Draíocht: Oh, technically speaking, Burgundy is actually +5% total, their *vassals'* dev is increased but +10%. Also, if it matters, the actually numbers involved are +3 England, +8 Milan, +8 Genoa, +15 Venice, +17 Burgundy, -10 Provence, +3 Silesia, -3 Pommerania, -19 Bavaria, +8 Koeln, +20 Byzantium, give or take 1 or 2 dev.
