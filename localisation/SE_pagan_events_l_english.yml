 SCA_DAHE.EVTDESC3: "A recent schism has happened in our religion. The patheons of other cultures have begun to make a return in the light of our righteous struggle to cast back the evil of the their God. Scholars cannot quite agree on whether or not we should be tolerant of such. Is there truly more pantheons than our own? Are they legitimate as well? Or do we have the right of it? Some are worried that if we do not allow other pantheons, we may become just like the followers of which we reject - and others that the disunity of the pantheons would fracture the nation."

 pagan_piety.5.d: "Faithful [Root.Religion.GetName] undertaking their pilgrimage to the holy city of [Root.Capital.GetName] have recently come under attack by roving bands of brigands. The scum have now become bold enough to attack even the larger caravans, and many lives have been lost. The people are crying out for justice, and our most pious warriors have asked for permission to escort these pilgrims safely through the realm."
 pagan_piety.6.d: "A low-ranking official in our government has distinguished himself and proven to be a very able administrator. He may be deserving of a promotion, but there is one problem - he is not a [Root.Religion.GetName] follower. All attempts to force his conversion have met with failure, and there are many who demand his immediate dismissal."
 pagan_piety.7.d: "Our realm has seen a sudden increase in the number of immigrants crossing our borders recently. Many are refugees fleeing wars and poverty elsewhere in the world, and most stubbornly refuse to give up their false religions and embrace the true faith of [Root.Religion.GetName]. Should we not close our borders to infidels such as these?"
 pagan_piety.8.d: "From across the realm, we have received reports of spontaneous acts of violence by [Root.Religion.GetName] mobs against unbelievers.

 pagan_piety.12.d: "A prominent and outspoken government official recently transferred home from the diplomatic corps seems to have spent a little too much of his time abroad. He has returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with some controversial ideas on how to interpret the words of Mother Nature, and needless to say, this has provoked a lot of ire amongst the clergy.

If they shared some of their riches with the state, the government could do a better job of safeguarding them and defending [Root.Religion.GetName] from all those who would seek to harm it."
 pagan_piety.16.d: "As our government becomes more secular, a new breed of pragmatism seems to have taken root in our officials and administrators. Unfortunately, the new climate has encouraged rampant corruption as well, with everyone concerned only about looking out for themselves. Many have called out for a return to the old ways, when our nation truly followed the path the shaman had laid out for us."
 druidism_flavor.1.t: "The Druids"
 druidism_flavor.1.d: "The Druids played a crucial role in Celtic life. Although there is no concrete absolute certainty about their roles and duties in society, there are several sources that point to similar features of this group. The druids were one of the two most important social classes in Celtic society, the other being nobles, and were responsible for organizing worship, sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedures. They were exempt from military service and taxes and had the power to excommunicate anyone from social festivals and such. Pomponius Mela claims that druids carried out their rituals in secret caves and trained by memorizing hundreds of verses by heart. Caesar remarked that such training could take up to twenty years to complete. All the verses were transmitted orally, and thus not a singe one has survived to the present day."

This ritual has helped shape the image of the druid in popular imagination as white-clad wise men performing sacrifices in forests."

Taranis was the god of thunder who carried a lightning bolt in one hand and a wheel in the other. Toutatis was the god of tribal protection whose sacrifices were made by plunging the victim headfirst into a vat filled with liquids. Lastly, Esus was seen carrying an axe and cutting branches from trees. His charms were known to cure throat troubles and other ailments."

 hellenic_flavor.1.d: "Based on Roman Mythology, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were born by the joining of their mother, Rhea Silvia, and the god Mars. After their birth, they were forcefully abandoned by the king Amulius in the Tiber river. Through a series of miraculous interventions, the river carried them to a she-wolf and woodpecker who nurtured them until they were taken in by a shepherd and his wife. Once the boys reached maturity, they learned of their origins, killed Amulius, and went on to found a new city. The two brothers quarrled over the location until Remus was killed. The city of Rome was then created, named after Romulus, on the 21st of April 753BC.

 hellenic_flavor.3.d: "In Latin, sacrificium simply meant the act of making something sacred. In fact, sacrifices to household dieties were common and included giving up things such as fruits, wheat, honey, wine incense, or even food that fell off the dinner table. The most potent sacrifices involved animals. They were first cleansed and then calmed due to the fact that tradition stated that the harmonisation of the earthly and divine was necessary. In other words, the animal needed to willingly offer its life and remain calm throughout its death. There were also recorded instances of human sacrifice during the early period of the Roman Republic, but this practice was officially ruled as murder in 81BC."

They cultivated the sacred fire of Rome and prevented it from extinguishing. If it did, it was considered a sign that the Gods had abandoned Rome. They also kept track of state rituals. They held immense power in the Roman world, allowing for the pardon of Caeser when he was an enemy of the state. The Vestal had to remain virgins for once they accepted the responsibility of their role, they were considered daughters of the state. Thus, if they had any sexual relations with any citizen of Rome, it was considered incest and they were killed for Treason.

Jarilo was the God of vegetation, fertility, and spring, while his sister and wife, Morana, was the Goddess of winter and death. The myth goes that after the harvest, Jarilo was unfaithful to Morana, causing her to spiral into an uncontrollable rage. She killed her husband and with the God of spring dead, the world's vegetation dies and the cold seeps in uniformaly. Morana then dies at the end of the year. This cycle repeats itself year after year and was used to explain the change in seasons. Now, we should choose which God we would support more. Jarilo could help us with our harvests, while Morana can make winter harder for our enemies."

Now the time has come to plan the next harvest festival, assign bakers, and hire priests. All of this will take the attention of the government from arguably more important matters."

 zoroastrianism_flavor.3.d: "Originiating in 3rd or 4th century BC, Zurvanism grew exponentially in influence during the Sassanid Empire (224 - 651 CE). Zurvanism was a branch of Zoroastrianism that claimed that Zurvan, God of space and time, was the original first principle and not Ahura Mazda. It was Zurvan who made the equal-but-opposite twins Ahura Mazda (who later made Amesha Spenta) and Angra Mainyu. Zurvan was percieved to be a god of infinite space and time who was neutral and without passion. To him, there was no distinction between good and evil. The cult continued to grow until the collapse of the Sassanid Empire in the 7th century. It was quickly suplanted by Islam and the remaining Zurvanism followers either converted to islam or to orthodox Zoroastrianism. By the 10th century, Zurvanism was extinct.\n\nHowever, recently with the revival of [Root.Religion.GetName] there has also been an increase of followers of Zurvan that demand we adhere to their ways."

Likewise, the Vendidad, which is the ecclesiastical code, and the Visperad, the collection of rituals, are both contained within the Avesta. Later editions of the Avesta had lesser texts inculding the Nyayesh texts, the Gah texts, the Yashts, the Siroza, and other small fragments that were called the Khordeh Avesta, or 'little Avesta'. The original master manuscript of the Avesta was published during the Sassanid Empire (224 - 651CE), but was eventually lost. Fragments from 9th and 10th century scriptures suggest that the original Avesta was four times larger than the fragments that remain in the present day."

Unmoved, [Root.Monarch.GetName] dismisses [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attenents. A dark entity had spoken to [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the night, revealing the truth that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] parent was seeking.
