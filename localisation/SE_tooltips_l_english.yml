 occitan_power_display_description: "§gThis is an information decision and cannot be enacted.\nMouse over the button to enact the decision to view the national statistics.§!\n\nEach province is described by a §YProvince Occitanism§! variable which evaluates to which culture group the people identify (actually rather the local elites, not the peasants). This variable will evolve smoothly as a function of many parameters (owner, owner culture, factions, accepted culture, ... ), and can slowly spread to nearby provinces. It can range from §Y0 to 100§!, and the province will have its culture 'converted' when the variable goes past §Y50§!, in a direction or the other. At §Y70§! §YProvince Occitanism§! the local elites will start embracing Catharism, and this will cause Occitanism and Catharism to spread into nearby territories. In a normal game with only AI Occitans, it will normally drop to zero, just as it did historically (it does not mean that Occitan has disappeared, just that it is disregarded by the local elites). While in an alternate history scenario, even the AI may attempt to resurrect the Occitan culture."
