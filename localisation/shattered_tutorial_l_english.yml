 trobador_tutorial_11_title: "Mod philosophy"
 trobador_tutorial_11_desc: "This mod concentrates on Occitania and Catalonia, giving them the opportunity to be more than subcultures within a cultural union, bound to disappear. It is made to be not only a mere flavouring component, but also to have very concrete consequences in term of gameplay. However, except if you start the Alternative-History scenario, the game will start in a state very similar to what it would have been without this mod. In that sense this mod does not correspond to the concept of Alternative-History. However, it kind of considers that even if a revival of the Occitan culture is relatively unlikely, it is the path the player is interested in. It means that we don't try to reproduce rigourously every detail of how historically France destroyed the Occitan culture. In this sense it is not a fully historical scenario neither. It is what I call Semi-Alternative History."
 trobador_tutorial_12_title: "Historial background"
 trobador_tutorial_12_desc: "Occitania and Catalonia are what is now considered as the South of France and East of Spain. It designate lands which have been occupied by Greeks and Romans very early, long before Caesar's incursions in Gallia, and deeply colonised instead of just controlled militarily. Added to a relatively weak influence of the Frank and Wisigoth invasions, plus the arabo-andalusian influence, this resulted in a much more latin/mediterranean culture. As latin begun to decay into romance languages, the local variations of romance became one of the first languages to get a unified identity, under the impulsion of the trobadors (litterally 'finders'), who needed a koine for their poetry. The name of the language mainly came later from Dante's work, one of a first works of linguistics, which separated the romance languages into three groups according to the word 'yes' ('oc' in the West, 'oil' in the North and 'si' in the East). Dante's ambition was in great part to turn the Italian dialects into something as prestigious as what Occitan was. Indeed, Occitan, usually called Limosin because many trobadors came from this region, became the most influent language for arts in Europe around centuries XIth-XIIIth, while latin was still used for science, laws and so on. However, this quickly collapsed after the Crusade against the Albigensians. The reasons of this Crusade were both religious (the Occitan lords being way too much tolerant towards heretics and heathens, or maybe more exactly the Franks and the Pope being much less tolerant than the Mediterranean standard) and political (Occitania and Catalonia were de-jure vassals of France. The gain of a King title by the House of Barcelona confirmed formally their independence, but it was still time for France to get back its influence in Occitania, which was mainly under the shared influence of the King of Aragon an his friend/cousin/rival/quasi-vassal the Count of Toulouse). The French victory in the Hundred Year War and the Black Death made it even worse, leaving Occitania under the complete control of France and unable to recover its strength, with its culture condemned to a slow decay. It is what you have to avoid!"
 trobador_tutorial_goto121: "What about the Alternative-History scenario?"
 trobador_tutorial_121_title: "What about the Alternative-History scenario?"
 trobador_tutorial_121_desc: "This scenario supposes that the Crusade failed and Occitania has been able to maintain a kind of statu-quo during one more century. Occitania is divided between the influence of France, Aragon, and England, with Toulouse in the middle. Additionally, the game starts with Marseille being an independent country, which is a slight exageration of what some people call 'The Republic of Marseille'. The city spent most of the XIIIth century being de facto independent, taking advantage of the post-Crusade instability and the weakening of the Aragonese influence, before the House of Anjou reconquered the city and put an end to this situation. Since I was not bound to History any more, I tried to take this opportunity to provide a different challenge to the players."
 trobador_tutorial_13_title: "Occitanism and Catalanism"
 trobador_tutorial_13_desc: "In Trobador's Revenge the cultural aspect has several layers: you have a new culture group, the province occitanism, and the factions (plus of course the will of the ruler himself, that you can even choose to role-play if you want). Those three (or four) elements work together to try to give some dynamics to the culture."
 trobador_tutorial_goto131: "Culture Groups"
 trobador_tutorial_131_title: "Culture Groups"
 trobador_tutorial_131_desc: "The cultures groups in EUIV are a very static tree, which doesn't allow having a culture in two different groups, measuring some cultural distance instead of a yes/no categorisation, or making the culture evolve in time. Occitan in 1444 is very different from Occitan in the later game, and one of the main goals of the mod is precisely to let the player change what 'Occitan' concretely means. Therefore an other culture-group has been added, 'Occitano-Catala', and the corresponding cultures can move from the Occitano-Catala group to the French/Iberian culture group, depending of how strong people are identificating themselves to one group or the other one."
 trobador_tutorial_goto132: "Province Occitanism"
 trobador_tutorial_132_title: "Province Occitanism"
 trobador_tutorial_132_desc: "Each province is described by a 'Province Occitanism' variable which evaluates to which culture group the people identify (actually rather the local elites, not the peasants). This variable evolve smoothly as a function of many parameters (owner, owner culture, factions, accepted culture, ... ), and can slowly spread to nearby provinces. It can get from 0 to 100, and the province will have its culture 'converted' when the variable goes past 50, in a direction or the other. In a normal game with only AI Occitans, it will normally drop to zero, just as it did historically (it does not mean that Occitan has disappeared, just that it is disregarded by the local elites). A decision titled 'Information: Province Occitanism' will show the value of this variable in your lands, so that you always have an idea of what is happening."
 trobador_tutorial_goto133: "Factions"
 trobador_tutorial_133_title: "Factions"
 trobador_tutorial_133_desc: "The factions represent the opinion of the influential people in the central government, which is both different from the simple people and from the monarch alone, although those can interact. Different factions give different modifiers, which can be quite important, and the availability of many decisions and events depend on the faction in power. The faction window can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Faction influence is mainly driven by a set of triggered modifiers, plus some particular modifiers and events, but can also be bought in the faction window or as a part of the effect of the 'sponsoring' decisions. Note that hiring a trobador is always a good idea if you want to give power to Occitanism and revive the era of the trobadors..."
 trobador_tutorial_goto1321: "Catharism"
 trobador_tutorial_1321_title: "Catharism"
 trobador_tutorial_1321_desc: "Once a province’s 'Province Occitanism' variable reaches 70, the local elite may start embracing Catharism again. You can chose to let them worship in peace, likely causing the province to flip to Cathar, or you can choose to disallow these heresies, but they may rise up against your oppression on top of a decrease in the local Occitanism variable. Once a majority of your populace embraces Cathar, your ruler will be pressured to convert as well, or else suffer a major religious revolt. If you or your neighbors convert to Cathar, the surrounding Catholic kings will take note of these heresies and will be able to call another crusade on the Cathars if they feel you are a threat to their church. Be carefull."
