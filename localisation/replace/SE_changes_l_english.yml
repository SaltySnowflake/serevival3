 ### SE GOODS
 ## Province Modifiers
 nile_estuary_modifier: "Nile Delta"
 desc_nile_estuary_modifier: "Not only does controlling the Nile Delta confer a trade advantage, it is also a very rich agricultural land."
 ## Tradegoods
 grain: "Wheat"
 grainDESC: "One of the oldest domnesticated crops, wheat was grown across the Old World, however it was not as hardy as barley or rye, and so it was found primarily in temperate regions. Correspondingly, wheat products became more of a symbol of plenty and status, particularly farther north, eaten primarily by the rich and those who governed, while the poor ate mostly barley, oats and rye."
 fish: "Fish"
 fishDESC: "Fish was one of the most basic foods for the European population in this age, as meat was more of a luxury for the great majority. Fishermen also provided the basic recruiting pool of the merchant and military navies of most nations."
 wool: "Wool"
 woolDESC: "Wool came mostly from the fleece of sheep and goats that grazed in the more marginal lands not suited to other forms of agriculture, and was, prior to the use of cotton, the major raw material for clothing. Herds were watched over by herders, often older men or women, or minors, who could not work efficiently in other parts of a farm or community. Sheep and goats were also kept for their milk and meat, though wool remained the primary resource."
 fur: "Fur"
 furDESC: "Furs were one of the basic elements of high quality and warm clothing. Skins from all kinds of animals were supplied initially from Russia but more and more from North America where beavers would be the prize of choice at least till the late middle 18th century. Many of the animals hunted for furs also provided a source of meat both for immediate consumption and for trade."
 naval_supplies: "Naval Supplies"
 naval_suppliesDESC: "To construct a ship was a long and complex process, involving many resources and manufactured goods, from wood and tar to ropes, linen, sails, and so on, which had to then be assembled by craftsmen. Reliable access to various naval supplies was one of the driving forces behind colonial expansion in the North America, in order to sustain national navies."
 tropical_wood: "Brazil"
 tropical_woodDESC: "Brazilwood was known for its dense orange-red wood which, in addition to yielding a red dye, became highly sought-after in Europe. It was used for carving but also for making musical instruments, violin bows in particular. The importance of the tree to the Portuguese colonies in Brazil is all but evident in the fact that the country derives its name from that of the tree. In Asia, a genetic relative, sappanwood, was cultivated for many of the same uses, but it saw a decline in favour of the much more accessible brazilwood."
 dyes: "Indigo"
 dyesDESC: "The indigo is a plant native to the subtropics, from which humans have long extracted dyes of the deep blue colour also known as indigo. Produced primarily in India (hence its name), indigo was not commonly available in Europe, where woad was more commonly used for the same colours. With the advent of sea routes around Africa, Indian goods, including indigo, became more available to the European market, and woad was quickly outcompeted by the superior dye."
 ivory: "Ivory"
 ivoryDESC: "Ivory was one of the main exports of Africa apart from slaves. It was highly sought after by Europeans for use in various manufactured goods such as cutlery, gifts, small pieces of art, furniture, etc. A slightly different type of ivory could also be harvested from walrus and narwhals in the Arctic, as well as mammoth ivory from Siberia."
 chinaware: "Porcelain"
 chinawareDESC: "Porcelain, also known as 'china' for the material's birthplace, is a ceramic material that was held in high esteem for its toughness, strength and translucence. The Chinese methods by which porcelain was made remained unkown to Europeans until the 1700s, and porcelain was just one of many highly sought-after export articles in the Sino-European trade of the day."
 slaves: "Slaves"
 slavesDESC: "Slaves had been a trading commodity since Antiquity, but demand increased sharply in the late 16th century when slaves offered one of the cheapest sources of labor for European plantations in the Americas. The African kingdoms of the day traded extensively in slaves with Europeans, in return for modern weapons and other manufactured goods. This formed two parts of the Triangle Trade, the third being the export of plantation goods like sugar and cotton from the New World to Europe."
 iron: "Iron"
 ironDESC: "Iron and other ferrous metals formed the basis of the metallurgical industry and was used extensively in the production of weapons and other military equipment."
 copper: "Copper"
 copperDESC: "Copper was the main component of bronze and was essential in the early production of cannons. It was also used in art, jewelery, currency and in utensils."
 spices: "Peppers"
 spicesDESC: "Peppers are a variety of fruits known for their spiciness, constituting the most used and traded forms of spices. Due to their value, peppers were at times even used as currency. In addition to the black peppers of South and East Asia, there are the chili (bell) peppers native to the Americas. As with other spices, Ottoman expansion blocking off supply was a driving force behind eventual European voyages around Africa and to the New World, in order to find sea lanes to India."
 ## Price Events
 JOHAN_FRIEDRICH_BOTTGER: "Porcelain Production in Europe"
 prices.3.t: "Johann Friedrich Böttger"
 prices.3.d: "Johann Friedrich Böttger was a German alchemist who was the first European to understand how to make porcelain. He discovered this in 1708, and his factory in Meissen, which was finished in 1710 was Europe's first porcelain factory. With the increasing popularity of procelain, pewter decreased in popularity."
 prices.3.a: "This will decrease the demand for Porcelain and Pewter."
 prices.20.t: "Bronze Cannons"
 prices.20.d: "The bronze cannon has made its entrance on the battlefield and is here to stay. The materials needed to feed the growing cannon-making industries have lead to an explosion in the demand for copper and tin over the last few years and prices have risen as a result."
 prices.20.a: "Ok."
 BRONZE_CANNONS: "Bronze Cannons"
 prices.28.t: "Development of Ironworking"
 prices.28.d: "Various advances in the field of ironworking have meant that the iron cannon is now both more efficient and reliable than the old bronze cannons. As iron products are also increasingly replacing copper in other fields, such as for mealtime utensils, the price of copper has been dropping while the demand for iron is on the rise."

While the new drink caught on quickly in some parts of European society it has taken some time, and large amounts of sugar and vanilla, before it reached a larger acceptance. With that out of the way however the demand for chocolate, and the vanilla to flavour it, is now steadily increasing in the old world."

 inti_events.2.d: "The priests of $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ have made it clear that [Root.Heir.GetName] must take his sister as his primary wife to please the gods. Many of his ancestors and even the god of the sun himself have married this way within the family and kept the bloodline pure. The boy's mother however refuses to hear of this and will not give her consent.\nThe proper way to solve this schism would be to ask our ancestor, the mummy that is the head of our Panaca lineage for guidance."
 inti_events.10.d: "Word has reached us that a local chief in [Root.GetName] has begun to construct an ambitious new temple for the main Huaca God of his tribe. As is often the case this Huaca also happens to be a mummified ancestor of his own lineage. While the chief seems content to acknowledge our authority it is hard to shake the notion that he is attempting to build a bigger power base for himself in [Root.GetName].\nThe priests of $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] strongly advocate that we remove the Huaca to put this chief in his place."
 inti_events.13.d: "The people of the province of [Root.GetName] are divided and worship various local Huaca Gods. It has therefore been decided that a great temple of $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ should be constructed here as a natural centre for the spiritual and administrative life of the region.\nThe leader of the construction has presented [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] with two different plans for the temple. The first plan is to construct the temple at a Tincuy, the sacred confluence of two streams, while the other plan calls for making use of an old Huaca shrine as the base of the new temple."
 inti_events.18.d: "The priests of a minor Huaca god in [Root.GetName] have been trying to inflame opinions against our rule by saying that we are slowly attempting to increase the authority of $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ and marginalize that of all the Huaca Gods. Luckily most of our subjects know better than to listen to these wild accusations but one of [Root.GetName]'s tribes supports the priests and have now demanded that we give them guarantees for the safety of their Gods and their people."

Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists opposed the growing government and rode the wave of popular fears of insidious royalism. Adams supporters retaliated by condemning the French Revolution as Monocracy, the former cherished by the Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists on the other hand still viewed England as the principal enemy and said that Adams was going to pay lip service to Her Majesty's Government. Washington's support and the New Englanders effort to stop Alexander Hamilton from sabotaging Adams campaign gave Adams a marginal electoral victory, 71-68. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?"
 usa_dlc.EVTNAME66: "US. Presidential Election of [GetYear]"
 usa_dlc.EVTDESC66: "Campaign and the Issues, [GetYear]: President Jefferson handily checked a feeble challenge from the dying Federalist Party. The Party had been severely damaged by a radical group within called the Essex Junta, which had tried in vain to enlist some eastern seaboard states to secede from the union forming a New England Confederacy free of Jeffersonian Democracy. Among the elites of the country many still supported the Federalists and Pinckney, but the masses were discouraged by the behavior of the Junta. The Biggest Issue was the Louisiana Purchase as Federalists feared that more immigrants (Jefferson-supporters that is) would break the balance of power at the expense of the Federalists. Thus Jefferson made significant inroads in once solidly Federalist New England and victory was his. Electoral Votes: Jefferson 162, Pinckney 14. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?"

As Secretary of State he had been handled the Embargo which was both retaliation against French and British disrespect and a policy of Protectionism. The Embargo was very unpopular in both camps, thus the Federalists once again revitalized under Charles Pinckney and Free-Trade Republicans threatened to support the republican vice presidential candidate George Clinton. The Free-Trade threat never materialized and although Pinckney did well he could not compete with the popularity of former President Jefferson. Jefferson was instrumental in urging fellows and foes alike to stand behind Madison and thus securing his victory. Electoral Vote: Madison 122, Pinckney 47, Clinton 6.

 usa_dlc.EVTDESC69: "Campaign and the Issues, [GetYear]: The War of [GetYear] dominated the campaign. Because the United States suffered early defeats in the West, DeWitt Clinton's supporters blasted the president for incompetence in directing the war effort, a war that Federalists denounced as groundless. Madison's campaigners defended the war as necessary to establish American neutral rights. Madison was not that popular, but two things turned against Clinton. First, Clinton tried to appeal to hawks and doves alike making his position non-credible. Second, Madison was a president at war and people rallied to his defense. Electoral Votes: Madison 128, Clinton 89. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?"

 usa_dlc.EVTDESC70: "Campaign and the Issues, [GetYear]: There were no big issues. James Monroe was supported by two popular former presidents, Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe was a skilled tactician doing very little campaigning. The election was a sure thing all from the beginning as there were in fact only one efficient party, the Republicans. The Federalists existed, but was trashed from opposing the War of 1812 and had its voters in the New England area. Its organization and form was old and obsolete and it did not even officially nominate a candidate. It though supported Rufus King who put up only token opposition against the republican juggernaut. The Republicans was on the other hand an all-American movement with strong bases in New York, Virginia and in the South from which it campaign with skill and effect. Four republican presidential terms in a row had strengthened the party proportionally to the decline of the Federalists. James Monroe won a walk-over even if it was not as superior as his victory in 1820 where he grabbed all electors but one. Electoral Votes: Monroe 183, King 34.
