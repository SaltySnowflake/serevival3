 BtPLegacyMisc.EVTDESC1:0 "A unique and distinct language and culture evolved from Old West Norse on the Northern Isles, know as Faroese and Norn.

 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTNAME1:0 "End of Brugge's Golden Age"
 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC1:0 "From at least the 12th century, Brugge was the richest and most important port in the North Sea. However, the Golden Inlet, the primary route to the North Sea from Brugge and also the reason for its immense wealth, began to fill with silt around the year 1500, leading to a progressive and sudden reduction of Brugge's importance as a centre of trade in the Low Countries as more and more trade moved to Antwerp."

 BtPLegacy_european_trade.EVTDESC4:0 "When Antwerp was sacked by the Spanish Fury, many of the skilled artisans, wealthy traders, and influencial families fled north, mostly to Amsterdam. This sudden immigration led to the rise of Amsterdam as a major world power and contributed to the so called 'Dutch Miracle', the transition of the Low Countries from minor vassal states to a major world power over the course of only 50 or 60 years."

 flavor_tus.EVTNAME24: "The Pazzi Conspiracy"
 flavor_tus.EVTDESC24: "The Pazzi conspiracy was a plot by members of the Pazzi family and others to displace the de' Medici family as rulers of Renaissance Florence. On 26 April 1478 there was an attempt to assassinate Lorenzo de' Medici and his brother Giuliano de' Medici. Lorenzo was wounded but survived; Giuliano was killed. The failure of the plot served to strengthen the position of the de' Medici. The Pazzi were banished from Florence."

 flavor_tus.EVTNAME25: "Bonfire of the Vanities"
 flavor_tus.EVTDESC25: "Friar Girolamo Savonarola was a Dominican priest who was assigned to work in Florence in 1490, largely thanks to the request of Lorenzo de' Medici- an irony, considering that within a few years Savonarola would become one of the foremost enemies of the Medici house and helped to bring about their downfall in 1494. Savonarola campaigned against what he considered to be the artistic and social excesses of Renaissance Italy, preaching with great vigor against any sort of luxury. His power and influence grew so that with time he became the effective ruler of Florence, and even had soldiers for his protection following him around everywhere. Starting in the February of 1495, during the time that would normally have hosted the festival known as Carnival, Savonarola began to host his regular “Bonfire of the Vanities.” He collected various objects that he considered to be objectionable; irreplaceable manuscripts, ancient sculptures, antique and modern paintings, priceless tapestries, and many other valuable works of art, as well as mirrors, musical instruments, books of divination, astrology, and magic. He destroyed the works of Ovid, Propertius, Dante, as well as Boccaccio. So great was his influence that he even managed to obtain the cooperation of major contemporary artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Lorenzo di Credi, who reluctantly consigned some of their own works to his bonfires. Anyone who tried to object found their hands being forced by teams of ardent Savonarola supporters. These supporters called themselves Piagnoni (Weepers) after a public nickname that was originally intended as an insult."

Once again, this has happened, and the Medici have concocted a scheme to reroute public funds into the bank under the pretense that it is in the financial interests of the state."

 flavor_mai.3.t: "Dombrand"
 flavor_mai.3.d: "The Cathedral of Mainz has burned down! In it's long history the Dom zu Mainz has been rebuilt and modified multiple times. It first burned down on the day of its completion in August 1009, only to be rebuilt immediately. After the fire of 1081 the cathedral was expanded with additional towers and chapels. Gothic elements and a greater belfry were added during the 14th and 15th century. The last significant work was done in 1579 when the eastern tower got a new spire. Now that the cathedral has lost its roof in the fire, how shall we restore it?"

 flavor_mai.4.t: "The Jesuit Order in Mainz"
 flavor_mai.4.d: "In 1561 archbishop Daniel Brendel von Homburg invited the Jesuit order to open a college in Mainz. His intention was to advance the counterreformation as many of the faithful had turned to protestant teachings. The Jesuit college was founded in 1568 and became one of the most important schools in the archbishopric. Even the university was run by Jesuits during parts of the 17th century. In the end, the counterreformation was successful as more and more of the protestant citizens returned to catholic dogma."

 flavor_mai.4b: "We don't want them here"
 flavor_mai.5.t: "A new electoral Residence"
 flavor_mai.5.d: "During the 17th century, the archbishops of Mainz built residences in many of the cities under their control. Notable palaces were built in Mainz, Aschaffenburg and Erfurt. Most of the electoral palaces were used as centres of administration and for diplomatic talks. There is benefit in the construction of such palaces, but we would have to maintain them."

 flavor_mai.6.d: "Mainz had been a fortress town since its founding by the Romans and would continue to be so, despite some of the strongholds being abandoned or destroyed. During and after the Thirty Years War, multiple fortresses where constructed and destroyed in and around the city. Shall we renew them once more?"

 flavor_mai.7.t: "Peasant's war in Thuringia"
 flavor_mai.7.d: "In 1525 the German Peasant's War finally reached the Mainzian lands, namely the Eichsfeld in Thuringia and the Oberstift in southern Hessia. Inspired by Martin Luther's theses, the peasants demanded lessened taxes, additional liberties and the institution of fair-minded laws. They were crushed by a joint army of several princes, but the protestant reformation had taken deep roots in the archbishopric. It would take until 1574 for the Eichsfeld populace to regain a majority of catholics."
 flavor_mai.7a: "Damn those peasants"
 flavor_mai.8.t: "Witches in Mainz"
 flavor_mai.8.d: "Although pope Innocent VIII called for witch hunts everywhere in 1484, the early archbishops opposed the practice, much to the chagrin of the pope. While some processes were tolerated in the 16th century, the archbishopric did not see massive witch hunts until 1594. The following witch trials would claim the lives of almost 2000 people within 20 years."

 flavor_mai.10.t: "The Stiftsfehde"
 flavor_mai.10.d: "In 1459 Diether von Isenburg had been elected archbishop of Mainz and began pushing for ecumenical and imperial reforms immediately. The pope refused to ratify him as archbishop and excommunicated him in 1461 after Diether had called for a council in Nuremberg. His intention was to abolish annates to be paid to the Vatican, as he had amassed a sizeable debt in the 1460 war against the Palatinate."
 flavor_mai.10a: "Push for liturgical reforms."
 flavor_mai.10b: "Appease the Pope. For now."
 flavor_mai.11.t: "Banned by the Pope"
 flavor_mai.11.d: "In 1461 the pope deposed and excommunicated Diether von Isenburg and named Adolf von Nassau archbishop - Diether's narrowly beaten adversery from the previous election. However, Diether still had the support of most of the free city of Mainz and bought the help of his former enemy prince-elector Friedrich of the Palatinate. As Adolf tried to take the city with the help of Bishops of Trier, Speyer, Baden, Metz and the counts of Württemberg and Baden, a bloody war erupted that would devastate the countryside and lead the archbishopric of Mainz to the brink of ruin."

 flavor_mai.11b: "Abdicate and gather support from the citizens"
 flavor_mai.12.t: "End of the Stiftsfehde"
 flavor_mai.12.d: "In reality, Diether von Isenburg had lost the Stiftsfehde in 1463, as Adolf von Nassau was able to conquer Mainz, despite Diether's earlier successes in 1462. Diether was eventually reelected as archbishop in 1475, after which he stopped pushing for reforms and enforced a conservative dogma, thereby gaining the favour of pope Sixtus IV."

 flavor_mai.12c: "Secure our position in the Archbishopric"
 flavor_mai.13.t: "End of the Stiftsfehde"
 flavor_mai.13.d: "After Adolf von Nassau finally took the city of Mainz in 1463, he banished 400 of the free citizens who had opposed his rule and revoked the free city status of Mainz. The city became part of a Vizedom, thereby falling completely under the Archbishop's control. Both the damage done to city and countryside, and the debt the Archbishop had gone into to pay for the war, lead to the decline of Mainz as an important center of trade and the continued rise of Frankfurt. While Mainz recovered eventually, it should never reach the same importance it relished in medieval times."

 flavor_mai.15.t: "Johann Philipp von Schönborn"
 flavor_mai.15.d: "Johann Philipp von Schönborn became Archbishop of Mainz in 1647. Since 1642 he had also been bishop of Würzburg and taken an important role in the peace talks leading to the Peace of Westphalia, because of his willingness to compromise. After the Thirty Years War his domestic and foreign policies were aiming for stability in both the Archbishopric and the Empire. He managed to revitalize the economy, encouraged the repopulation of the country and built important public works such as the citadel, libraries and hospitals. His theologic achievements include a reform of the catholic mass, tolerance of protestant churches and teachings, and the ban of witch hunting."
 flavor_mai.15a: "His work will be remembered."
 flavor_mai.16.d: "Once, in medieval times, the jewish community of Mainz had made up about 15% of the cities population. But due to persecution during the crusades and the plague years, the community had dwindled to about 100 people. After the Stiftsfehde in the 15th century, most jews had fled Mainz and others were expelled. The community was revived during the 17th and had once again grown so big, that christian businessmen complained about the Jew's competion. This lead to the laws of 1662 and 1671, in which the number of jewish families allowed was stipulated. The discrimination persisted until the 18th century, when the enlightenment reached Mainz and the French Revolution brought equality, even for the jews."

 flavor_mai.17.d: "An avid follower of the Enlightenment movement, Archbishop Emmerich Joseph spent much effort on reforming all aspects of the clerical administration. Overcomplicated hierarchies and laws were reformed to allow a more efficient gathering of taxes, the investment and use of said money was better regulated and the church calender was cleared up to allow a more efficient use of his subject's time. To reform the education system, Emmerich Joseph reduced the influence of monastic orders, reorganized the university, changed the curriculum to conform to the ideas of enlightenment and reorganized the training of teachers and professors. Which reforms are more important to us?"

 flavor_mai.18.t: "The Favorite palace and gardens"
 flavor_mai.18.d: "Construction of the Favorite summer palace began just outside of Mainz in 1700 and finished in 1722. Situated directly on the Rhine banks and protected from wind by the hills, it was used to house guests of state and hold marvelous celebrations. The gardens and waterfountains were built in typical barock fashion, meant to impress and in a wide variety of styles. With grottos, pavillons, an orange grove and long promenades the area offered delights to every man's taste. Now that we can built a palace befitting our position, how grand shall we make it?"

 legatus_mai765.d: "Good news! The Pope is considering to grant us the prestigious title of §WLegatus Natus§b - his representative north of the Alps - after the former holder fell from grace. \nSuch a title demands a certain level of dignity and we cannot let our devotion or prestige, and our relations with the Pope drop too low."

 primas_mai759.d: "Since the nine hundreds the Archbishopric of Mainz have held the prestigious title of §WPrimas Germaniae§b - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nNaturally, such a title will inspire jealousy among the other princes of the Empire... We must take heed and not let our prestige drop below theirs, or we might find the title slip from our fingers!"
 primas_mai760.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, much of the Catholic community seem to have lost their faith in us! There are even rumors that another Archbishop plans to claim our title as Primas Germaniae!"
 primas_mai761.d: "The title of §WPrimas Germaniae§b - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire - was created in the nine hundreds when the Archbishopric of Mainz became the first Archbishopric to receive it.\n\nFor the second-rate power of $FROMCOUNTRY$ to hold such a prestigious title seems an affront to the Catholic Church. Perhaps a more worthy candidate can be found?"
 primas_mai762.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, we have lost the prestigious title of §WPrima Germaniae§b! Due to his higher standing in the empire of lately, another Archbishop has gone ahead and claimed the title!"

By that virtue they were recognized as spiritualized angels by their followers. As such, one of their main roles was to administer the Consolamentum to the dying. However, this sacrament could also be given to the living. The oldest Perfect of the realm came to us, offering his services to administer the Consolamentum to you. By receiving this sacrament, you will also become a Perfect, meaning that the chances to have an heir will be lowered. But in return, you might receive some valuable knowledge from the Heavens."

During a visit in Rome, he received a mission from the Pope: travel to the regions affected by heresy, and preach the Gospel. He decided to found a Catholic monastery in our nation to convert Cathars. Following this affront, a theological dispute is organized over several days between Dominic and one of our Cathar bishops. However, the verbal jousting takes a surprising turn: the scriptures of the two speakers are subject to the judgment of God, and are thrown into the fire.

Although this demonstration had little effect on the population, it is a blow to the Cathars. Dominic returned to Rome, his head held high.

But for now, this humiliation shakes our nation, and we decide to raise the papacy to the rank of historic rival."

After the lost Battle of Trencín, Jánošík was recruited by the Slovakian army. In autumn 1710, as a young prison guard in Bytca, he helped the imprisoned Tomáš Uhorcík escape. They formed a highwayman group and Jánošík became its leader at the age of 23, after Uhorcík left to settle in Klenovec. The group was active mostly in northwestern Slovakia, around the Váh river between Vazec and Východná, but the territory of their activity extended also to other parts of today's Slovakia, as well as to Poland and Moravia. Most of their victims were rich merchants. Under Jánošík's leadership, the group was exceptionally chivalrous They did not kill any of the robbed victims and even helped an accidentally injured priest. They are also said to share their loot with the peasants and poor people."

 flavor_svk.4.d: "His trial took place on March 16 and March 17, 1713 when he was sentenced to death. A hook was pierced through his left side and he was left dangling on the gallows to die. This brutal way of execution was reserved for leaders of robber bands. A legend says that he refused the grace offered in exchange for enlisting soldiers of his abilities with the words: \"If you have baked me so you should also eat me!\" and jumped on the hook."

 flavor_svk.5.t: "Anniversary of the death of King Svatopluk"
 flavor_svk.5.d: "Svatopluk was a ruler of Great Moravia, which attained its maximum territorial expansion during his reign (870–894). The core territories of Great Moravia were located between the valley of the river Morava and town Nitra. It says that the powerful Great Moravian king Svatopluk asked his sons to come to him before his death. He gave a twig to each of them and asked them to break it. The young noblemen could easily do it. Then he asked them to tie together three twigs and asked the sons again to break them. This task appeared to be more difficult. Thus the king demonstrated how it is necessary to be united. That only the strength of a united kingdom guarantees the country its power and prosperity. Finally Moravia collapsed in the first decade of the 10th century due to the invasion of the Hungarians"

 leonardo.EVTNAME7: "Reforming the Government of Florence"
 leonardo.EVTDESC7: "Comissioned by the Pope, Machiavelli's Discourse on Reforming the Government of Florence was a scathing critique of the failings of the Florentine Republic. In particular he criticised the fact that Florence was neither a true republic not a true principality. A true republic would not be so dominated by a few powerful, corrupt families. A true principality would have a single, legitimate monarch. Florence was neither, and thus doomed to failure."
 leonardo.EVTOPTA7: "Wise words."

 leonardo.EVTOPTA12: "Nonsense!"
 leonardo.EVTNAME8: "The Art of War"
 leonardo.EVTDESC8: "Niccolo Machiavelli, whom we have wisely hired into our service, has produced a socratic dialogue titled The Art of War. The purpose is 'To honor and reward virtù, not to have contempt for poverty, to esteem the modes and orders of military discipline, to constrain citizens to love one another, to live without factions, to esteem less the private than the public good.' To these ends, Machiavelli notes in his preface, the military is like the roof of a palazzo protecting the contents."
 leonardo.EVTOPA8: "Brilliant!"
 leonardo.EVTNAME9: "Leonardo's Siege Engines"
 leonardo.EVTDESC9: "We have wisely employed Leonardo da Vinci as a siege engineer. In a letter, Leonardo assures us that 'When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.'"
 leonardo.EVTOPTA9: "Sounds promising"
 leonardo.EVTNAME10: "Leonardo's Hydraulic Innovations"
 leonardo.EVTDESC10: "Leonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. He wrote that he could build 'very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.' Among his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood Pisa. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed Venice and came up with a plan to create a movable dyke for the city's protection against invaders."
 leonardo.EVTOPTA10: "Flood Pisa you say?"
 leonardo.EVTNAME11: "The Mona Lisa"
 leonardo.EVTDESC11: "The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as 'the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world'. The painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506. Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. The subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work."

The Jonang monasteries were either closed or forcibly converted, and that school remained in hiding until the latter part of the 20th century.

Its height rose to 131ft. In her later years Shin Sawbu's health declined and she had her bed placed so that she could look upon the gilded dome of the stupa.

One reason for Iskandar Muda’s success, in contrast to the weaker sultans who preceded and succeeded him, was his ability to suppress the Acehnese elite. Through the royal monopoly on trade, he was able to keep them dependent on his favor. He sought to create a new nobility of 'war leaders' whom he gave districts in feudal tenure. He passed legal reforms which created a network of courts using Islamic jurisprudence. His system of law and administration became a model for other Islamic states in Indonesia. Iskandar Muda’s reign was also marked by considerable brutality, directed at disobedient subjects. He also did not hesitate to execute wealthy subjects and confiscate their wealth."

 borneo.t1: "Foundation of the Lanfang Republic"
 borneo.d1: "The sultans of Western Borneo imported Chinese laborers in the 18th century to work in gold or tin mines.The founding father of the Lanfang Republic was Luo Fangbo who hailed from Meizhou in Guangdong Province. Chinese settlers have long lived in Borneo island, with most engaging in trading and mining. They formed their own companies, among which was the Southern Company headed by Luo. As Dutch imperialism encroached upon modern-day Indonesia, Luo established the Lanfang Republic in 1777 (with its capital in East Wanjin) to protect the Chinese settlers and other indigenous peoples from Dutch oppression. The settlers subsequently elected Luo as their inaugural president. Luo implemented many democratic principles, including the idea that all matters of state must involve the consultation of the republic's citizenry. He also created a comprehensive set of executive, legislative, and judicial agencies. The Republic did not have a standing military, but had a defense ministry that administered a national militia based on conscription. During peacetime, the populace mostly engaged in farming, production, trading, and mining. Lanfang's administrative divisions included three tiers (province, prefecture, and county) with the people electing leaders for all levels. Although Luo discarded the ancient institutions of monarchism and dynastic succession, he continued to adhere to many Chinese traditions. For example, he established the founding year of the republic as the first year of the calendar. Moreover, he submitted a report to the Chinese emperor notifying him about the Republic's founding and paid tribute to the Chinese Qing Empire. Although the Republic had both ethnic Chinese citizens (numbering in the tens of thousands) and indigenous subjects (numbering in the hundreds of thousands), the ethnic Chinese were the only ones who voted in presidential elections. Thus, Luo would not dare call himself a king in front of the ethnic Chinese citizens, but was not afraid to do so in front of his indigenous subjects."

The Border Rievers were both English and Scottish and raided both sides of the border impartially, so long as the people they raided had no powerful protectors and no connection to their own kin. Their activities, although usually within a day's ride of the Border, extended both north and south of their main haunts. English raiders were reported to have hit the outskirts of Edinburgh, and Scottish raids were known as far south as Yorkshire. The main raiding season ran through the early winter months, when the nights were longest and the cattle and horses fat from having spent the summer grazing. The numbers involved in a raid might range from a few dozen to organised campaigns involving up to three thousand riders."

Towards the end of the 16th century, the Hostmen began to buy up leases in the Tyneside coalfield until they soon had a near total monopoly of the production of coal. This led to their being named the 'Lords of Coal'. n 1600 the Company of Hostmen was incorporated through a charter granted by Elizabeth I. This gave them exclusive rights to trade coal in the Tyne in return for a one-shilling tax on every wagonload of coal shipped from the Tyne. The charter allowed an exclusive body of electors, in practice the Hostmen, the right to elect the mayor and burgesses of the town."

It was host to a huge 45-day trading event, which was exceptionally long for a fair in those times. Merchants came to it from all areas of England, Norway, Denmark, the Baltic states and the Byzantine Empire. The Fair originated from a charter granted by King Henry III in 1253. Naturally, such a large occasion attracted a lot more than just tradesmen; they needed to be entertained and fed, therefore large crowds of buyers, sellers and pleasure-seekers attended the fair."

 york.EVTDESC4: "The Council of the North was created in 1472 by Edward IV to improve government control and economic prosperity in the North, with permission to issue letters in the king’s name. The council was based at Sandal in Yorkshire. The council was in residence by 20th July 1484 and sessions were held at York. The main responsibilities were to keep the peace and punish lawbreakers. The council’s budget was 2,000 marks per annum and issued regulations which meant that councillors had to act impartially and declare any vested interests, and also meet every three months at least. It was essentially an autonomous branch of the king's council."

Resistance to the Reformation was the spur to the recreation of the council. Resentment arose in the North following the English Reformation, the Church of England's split from Rome and the dissolution of the Monasteries. In the North, most people remained staunch supporters of the Catholic faith and were deeply unhappy with the changes. The purpose of the Council was to ease the transition to Anglicanism in the North by avoiding violent confrontations."

 york.EVTDESC7: "Queen Elizabeth I of England was renowned for her celibacy. Elizabeth's unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both, not as a normal woman. At first, only Elizabeth made a virtue of her virginity. In 1559, she told the Commons; 'And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin'. Later on, poets and writers took up the theme and turned it into an iconography that exalted Elizabeth. Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen's marriage negotiations with the Duke of Alençon. Putting a positive spin on her marital status, Elizabeth insisted she was married to her kingdom and subjects, under divine protection. In 1599, she spoke of 'all my husbands, my good people'."

King Henry sent Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland to collect taxes to help raise more money for this campaign. However, many of the people in Northumberland and Yorkshire claimed to have already paid their part through local taxes. Rebellion broke out in April 1489. The results of this rebellion led the rebels to receive a royal pardon, and no further taxes were collected, thus Henry was unable to get enough money to defend Brittany. He also became aware of the lawless nature of the North of England, which had been loyal to King Richard III, who had spent more time in the North than any previous King of England."

 york.EVTNAME9: "Rising of the North"
 york.EVTDESC9: "The Rising in the North was an unsuccessful attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. Many English Catholics, then a significant portion of the population, supported Mary's claim as a means of relief from religious persecution. This position was especially strong in Northern England, where several powerful nobles were Catholics. The rebellion was led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, who in November 1569 occupied Durham and celebrated Mass in Durham Cathedral. Such public Catholic worship had been prohibited by the Protestant Queen Elizabeth. Heavily outnumbered by the Crowns forces led by the Earl of Sussex however, the rebels were forced to gradually retreat north, eventually dispersing entirely in Scotland. Westmorland and Northumberland remained in Scotland to escape reprisals, but Northumberland was later captured and beheaded, while Nothumberland died penilless in Flanders. Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile."

 york.EVTDESC10: "The Pilgrimage of Grace was a popular rising in Yorkshire in the autumn of 1536 in protest against Henry VIII's break with the Roman Catholic Church, the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the policies of the King's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. Many ordinary peasants were worried that their church plate would be confiscated. There were also popular rumours at the time which hinted that baptism might be taxed. The recently released Ten Articles and the new order of prayer issued by the government in 1535 had also made official doctrine more reformed. This went against the conservative beliefs of most northerners. The initial success of the Rising was great enough for the king to promise pardons and a parliament to address the Northerner's grievances. However, In February 1537 a new rising took place in Cumberland and Westmorland called Bigod's Rebellion. This time Henry was not so lenient, and the leaders of both this rebellion and the previous one were convicted of treason. Many were beheaded, while others were hung in chains. Thomas Moigne, was hanged, drawn and quartered. In total 216 were executed."

The eruption devastated Iceland and the environmental effects could be felt in many places throughout the world. Jón Steingrímsson, a local Lutheran pastor, grew famous because of his eldmessa (Sermon of Fire), which he delivered as his congregation took refuge in the town church. His sermon was credited with stopping the advance of the lava flow. It was later printed as Eldrit in 1788. It is believed that up to 80 percent of livestock died, and an estimated one-fifth of the human population of Iceland (approximately 10,000 people) perished from the combined effects of the mists and the resulting famine."

Tin miners were angered as the scale of the taxes overturned previous rights granted by Edward I of England to the Cornish Stannary Parliament which exempted Cornwall from all taxes of 10ths or 15ths of income. In reaction to King Henry's tax levy, Michael Joseph, a blacksmith from St. Keverne and Thomas Flamank a lawyer of Bodmin, incited many of the people of Cornwall into armed revolt against the King. An army some 15,000 strong marched into Devon, attracting support in terms of provisions and recruits as they went."

The crowns appointment of William Body as head of the effort to remove Catholic symbology from the region has further inflamed the situation.

The jurates were chosen at special courts held in each stannary by tinners, a term broad enough to include not just miners and tin work owners, but others concerned with the tin industry. The Parliament usually met in an open air forum at Crockern Tor. The Stannary Courts administered equity for the region's tin-miners and tin mining interests, and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines.

The intention was to create a single state and a single legal jurisdiction. These measures were not unpopular with the Welsh gentry in particular, who recognised that they would give them equality under law with English citizens. The reaction of many of the prominent Welsh of the day and down the centuries were very similar — gratitude that the laws had been introduced and made Wales a peaceful and orderly country. It was only much later that some of the Welsh started to feel that the privileges of citizenship were only given to the Welsh on condition that they forgot their own particular past and personality, denied their Welshness, and merged with England."
